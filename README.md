# Senses Share Materials
Here live the single folder with downloadable material for each Senses module.

# How to
To provide downloadable material for your module you will have to create a
folder with the module name.

* Each folder will contain a __readme file__ to document the actual content of the
folder
* __Images__ will be named according to a standard convention:
```
[number]-[title].png
```
* Independently from __data formats__ each dataset should have consistent
metadata to support their use.
